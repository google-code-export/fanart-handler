==Naming Convention for your custom fanart==
If you add music or video fanart that you want the skin to use when you select a video or music (or play music) you should follow the following naming convention. If the current played artist in MP is Madonna that will be matched in the fanart folder for any image that starts with "madonna" followed by n umbers and a file extenstion. This means a file named "madonna1.jpg" will be a match. This means a file named "This Is A Madonna Image.jpg" will not be a match. And a file named madoXnna.jpg will not be a match. And Madonna010.jpg will be a match.

===Music Fanart Options===
*Selected Fanart Sources - MP Artist Thumbs*<br>
Check this option if you want the artist thumbnail images that MediaPortal automatically downloads for an artist to be used when you select a music artist/album/track in MediaPortal. These images are often in low resolution (=bad quality) but setting the "Minimum Resolution For Images" option can solve this problem.

*Selected Fanart Sources - MP Album Thumbs*<br>
Check this option if you want the album thumbnail images that MediaPortal automatically downloads for an albun to be used when you select a music artist/album/track in MediaPortal. These images are often in low resolution (=bad quality) but setting the  "Minimum Resolution For Images" option can solve this problem.

*Selected Fanart Sources - Music Fanart Directory*<br>
Check this option if you want the fanart/backdrop images that you have donwloaded/created and put in the "/thumbs/Skin Fanart/music" folder or the fanart/backdrops that this plugin downloads (if scraper is enabled) to be used when you select a music artist/album/track in MediaPortal. Enabling this option is recommended.

Check this opton if you have enabled the option "MP Artist Thumbs" above but does not want these images available when a skin puts random images as backdrops for example when selecting a menu like pictures.

allready in your MediaPortal music database and then 
downloading the found images to your harddrive (to 
the "thumbs/Skin Fanart/music" folder). Leaving this 
option unchecked will disable scraping and you will 
have to manually add your fanart images to the

The first time you open MediaPortal after enabling the scraper

new added artists. If you at a later stage decided that you for 
example want to increase the number of imges per artis
you will have to press this button to initiate a new intitial scrape
the next time you start MediaPortal. After the initial scrape this
plugin will only scrape the htbackdrop site for new images.
