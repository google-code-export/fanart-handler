==Naming Convention for your custom fanart==
If you add music or video fanart that you want the skin to use when you select a video or music (or play music) you should follow the following naming convention. If the current played artist in MP is Madonna that will be matched in the fanart folder for any image that starts with "madonna" followed by n umbers and a file extenstion. This means a file named "madonna1.jpg" will be a match. This means a file named "This Is A Madonna Image.jpg" will not be a match. And a file named madoXnna.jpg will not be a match. And Madonna010.jpg will be a match.

==Enable Fanart for Music== 
Click on the "Common Settings" tab.
<br>
===Music Fanart Options===
*Selected Fanart Sources - MP Artist Thumbs*
Check this option if you want the artist thumbnail images that
MediaPortal automatically downloads for an artist to be used
when you select a music artist/album/track in MediaPortal. These
images are often in low resolution (=bad quality) but setting the 
"Minimum Resolution For Images" option can solve this problem.

*Selected Fanart Sources - MP Album Thumbs*
Check this option if you want the album thumbnail images that
MediaPortal automatically downloads for an albun to be used
when you select a music artist/album/track in MediaPortal. These
images are often in low resolution (=bad quality) but setting the 
"Minimum Resolution For Images" option can solve this problem.

*Selected Fanart Sources - Music Fanart Directory*
Check this option if you want the fanart/backdrop images that
you have donwloaded/created and put in the "/thumbs/Skin Fanart/music"
folder or the fanart/backdrops that this plugin downloads (if scraper
is enabled) to be used when you select a music artist/album/track 
in MediaPortal. Enabling this option is recommended.

*Use Fanart In Now Playing Overlay - Use Fanart In Overlay*
This option enables fanart as background in the now
playing window in MediaPortal if your current skin
supports it.

*Disable Fanart Sources (Random Images*
Two options exist in this section:
  * MP Artist Thumbs
  * MP Album Thumbs
selecting both these optins means that these source will not be included when providing random images for music (only fanart from the Music Fanart Directory). This option exit because you may want to enable or example MP Artist Thumbs when browing music in the myMusic  plugin but think the resolution is to bad to be used in basichome when navigating the music menu.

===Music Plugin Fanart Option===
*Enable Fanart For Selected Items*
Select this option if you want to enable fanart when browing your music collection in for example myMusic, mVids or Music Videos.

===Video Plugin Fanart Option===

Select this option if you want to enable fanart when browing your movie collection in the myVideo plugin.

===ScoreCenter Plugin Fanart Option===
*Enable Fanart For Selected Genres*
Select this option if you want to enable fanart when browing different genres in the ScoreCenter plugin.

===Minimum Resolution For Images===
This option sets the minumum resolution for images in the plugin. For example: an image for music exist in resolution 356x400 but you have set minimum resolution to 400x400. This means that the image will not be dispalyed by the plugion. This option exists so that you can disable the use of low resolution images. Set this to "0x0" to disable the check and allow all images.

===Show Each Image For===
This option controls how long each image will be displayed before next image for selected or played artist/title will be displayed.

===Scraper Options===
*Enable Automatic Download Of Music Fanart For Artists In Your MP MusicDatabase*
Check this option if you want the artist thumbnail images that
MediaPortal automatically downloads for an artist to be used
when you select a music artist/album/track in MediaPortal. These
images are often in low resolution (=bad quality) but setting the 
"Minimum Resolution For Images" option can solve this problem.

search the internet site www.htbackdrops.com for
fanart/backdrops mathing all the artists that you have 
allready in your MediaPortal music database and then 
downloading the found images to your harddrive (to 
the "thumbs/Skin Fanart/music" folder). Leaving this 
option unchecked will disable scraping and you will 
have to manually add your fanart images to the
"thumbs/Skin Fanart/music" folder.

Warning; Using this option if you have a large music
collection can use quite alot of harddisk space.

fanart/backdrops mathing evry song you play in

*Download Max X Images Per Artist*
Choose how many images the scraper will try to
download for every artist. Choosing a higher number
will consume more harddisk space. 

*Scraper Interval X (Hours)*
Select the  number of hours between each new scraper attempt.

*Reset Scraper Button*
The first time you open MediaPortal after enabling the scraper
will cause a big search for fanart matching every artist you
have in your MediaPortal music database. This is only done once.
After this MediaPortal will perorm this "initial scrape" only for
new added artists. If you at a later stage decided that you for 
example want to increase the number of imges per artis
you will have to press this button to initiate a new intitial scrape
the next time you start MediaPortal. After the initial scrape this
plugin will only scrape the htbackdrop site for new images.
